ct_analyzer - Constant-Time Assembly Analyzer

A portable tool for detecting timing side-channel vulnerabilities in compiled
cryptographic code by analyzing assembly output for variable-time instructions.

This tool analyzes assembly from multiple compilers (gcc, clang, go, rustc)
across multiple architectures (x86_64, arm64, arm, riscv64, etc.) to detect
instructions that could leak timing information about secret data.

Usage:
    uv run ct-analyzer [options] <source_file>

Examples:
    # Analyze a C file with default settings (clang, native arch)
    uv run ct-analyzer crypto.c

    # Analyze with specific compiler and optimization level
    uv run ct-analyzer --compiler gcc --opt-level O2 crypto.c

    # Analyze a Go file for arm64
    uv run ct-analyzer --arch arm64 crypto.go

    # Analyze with warnings enabled (shows conditional branches)
    uv run ct-analyzer --warnings crypto.c
