# Fetch gradio at a pinned commit and inject the eval's vulnerabilities.
#
# The codebase is NOT vendored: it is ~283 MB with 772 Python files, which is the
# point — the eval needs a codebase large enough that a single linear read cannot
# hold it. Only the patch and the ground truth live in this repo.
#
# The SHA is pinned because ground truth records absolute line numbers. Track main
# and the patch stops applying, the line numbers drift, and the eval silently
# grades against the wrong code.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup-gradio.sh            # fetch into ./work/gradio (idempotent)
#   ./setup-gradio.sh --force    # discard and re-fetch
#   ./setup-gradio.sh --clean    # delete the checkout
